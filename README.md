<b>Note:</b> Using this on websites is likely to result on false negatives of ports being closed.

## Requirements
Python3 needs to be installed.

## How to use
On Linux, open a terminal session and execute the script with "python3 port_scanner.py". On Windows, open the script as a executable using Python.
