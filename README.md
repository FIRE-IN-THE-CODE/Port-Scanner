# Port-Scanner
This program is a simple port scanner that can probe ports of a firewall or router.

Note: Using this on websites is likely to result on false negatives of ports being closed.

## Requirements
Python3 needs to be installed.

## How to use
On Linux, open a terminal session and execute the script with "python3 port_scanner.py". On Windows, open a powershell session and execute the script with "py port_scanner.py".
